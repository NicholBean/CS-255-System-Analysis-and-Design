# CS-255-System-Analysis-and-Design


## Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

For the DriverPass Project, our client; DriverPass, wanted to have a system for assisting customers with getting their license. This system consisted of creating an account, purchasing a package, selecting a driver and time, and going through a learning course with the selected driver until they are deemed ready for taking their course for their license. The system also consists of functions for the staff, allowing the owner of DriverPass to view documents while offline, resetting and disabling accounts when needed, and giving permissions to their staff. The secretary is able to edit and cancel driving appointments and the driver is allowed to accept appointments, progress the student's progress bar for their course, and add notes for the customer to see.

## What did you do particularly well?

I believe I did the research documents well by answering all of the questions the clients had and elaborate on why these decisions are made and how they are made without confusing the client with technical terms.

## If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

If I could pick a part to revise, I would choose to revise the activity diagrams and improve them by making their dependencies make more sense such as looping certain functions until the customer completes them.

## How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I interpretted the user's needs and implemented them into the system design by first researching the information that the client wanted at first and then implement them into the system. These implementations were then elaborated on how they work without including technical terms to prevent confusion and allow the user's needs to be met. It is important to consider the user's needs when designing because it can make the site easier to guide through.

## How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

When designing software, I like to gather information on what the wants and needs are before starting to sketch an idea. Using techniques like gathering use cases and implementing how they're worked in the system makes gathering information easier.
